                            <li>he's the sweetest, smartest most eager to love you kinda guy.</li>
                            <li>He loves snuggling on the couch with you and following you around the house.</li>
                            <li>He takes direction well and is learning boundries.</li>
                            <li>He absolutely loves Dyna the black cat and is scared of Pina the Tortie, he growls at her sometimes when she gets close and he's sleeping.</li>
                            <li>He will trample poor little Bambino when he's excited and doesn't really seem to have an awareness of where his body is, smacks his head and butt into the walls and tables daily :)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>He was found on the side of the road last Feb 2020 after being hit by a car</li>
                            <li>he has metal plates fused in his front paws and major hip displasia which is why he's a little wobbily after laying down.</li>
                            <li> He shouldn't be running too much, jumping or anything too rigorous as it might tear his metal plates (already tore his right one a few months ago but doesn't bother him at the moment) or put his hip sockets out of joint.</li>

                            <li>He also has separation anxiety and does not like being left alone, lots of barking and howling which upsets Bambino too and he will soil his bed and step in it :(</li>
                            <li>the crate training we've been doing has been helping a bit but, it's gonna take some time.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>training</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>So we did training with APA which was a helpful start but over the past year he has gotten more protective and aggressive with people.</li>
                            <li> He growls at people waking up to the house, delivery people or mailman, or even people parking close.
                            </li>
                            <li> right after nipping at a person walking behind him at a coffee shop.. we knew we needed professional intervention!</li>
                            <li> She made sure we understood that we need to set boundries, claim stuff like the door and front window, don't let him come up to us for affection or follow us around.</li>
                            <li>We had to be the leaders and initiate affection and invite him into our space.</li>
                            <li>We use the corrective low toned growl sound: "BAHHHH" sometimes with a clap or water squirt if needed, then followed with a higher toned: "good boy!" and optional treats</li>
                            <li>the undesired behavior: growling/barking/coming up for affection/violating the boundry of stay or walking ahead of us on leash. </li>
                            <li>If he ever growls or barks at you - this "BAHHHH" with optional clap then "Good Boy" with optional treats is the correction we were told would work</li>
                            <li>also first greeting should be arms and hands up by the chest and no eye contact while he sniffs, when he finally ignores he gets a pet/tread/good boy</li>I'll leave all the printed materials... we certainly don't expect you
                            to continue the training, you can spoil him and just have fun! But we want you to feel safe, secure and confident with our power breed!
                            <li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>food instructions</h3>
                        <p>Get ready for this proprietary blend! Max gets fed twice a day in the morning and evening - usually around 3 or 4ish depending on when Bambino starts whining lol
                            <h4>
                                Here's the breakdown for each feeding:
                            </h4>
                            <ul>

                                <li>
                                    Using the half cup scoop in the dry food bin, give him 2 scoops dry (1 cup) in his big ceramic dog bowl.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    in the fridge all the wet stuff is pre-portioned out for each day so add in half of that in the am / other half in the pm
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    add in some water and mix it all in, if the raw food is too frozen he might throw it up so make sure it's a nice soupy blend!
                                </li>
                                <li>since the shelf life for raw is only 5 days, pull out the pre-portioned from the freezer into the fridge on saturday for sun/mon</li>

                                <li>Make him "Go to bed" in his crate while you're getting it all ready, he lays down and doesn't move. Then put it in front of him, wait a few seconds and say "Okay!" he will eat it laying down in his crate or even put it
                                    a few feet in front of the crate so he can stand up and eat it.
                                </li>
                                <li> Fill his water bowl everyday, he drinks about half a gallon a day!

                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <h3>pottytime</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Max needs to potty about 3 times a day: after breakfast / in the afternoon / and after dinner / sometimes we do a quick pee check before bed or leaving for a couple hours</li>
                            <li>after breakfast/dinner he goes out back with Bambino, make sure you stay out there with him or he won't go, I like to sit at the table or on the porch and say in high tone to both "Go Potty" and snap my fingers a few times</li>
                            <li>Max will ask for affection so either bahh him until he goes sniffing to relief himself or give him pets then ignore him</li>
                            <li>he will pace on the side of the house or back and then poop</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>exercise</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>feel free to take him on a walk with the barkbuster leash and collar!</li>
                            <li>if he pulls ahead or tries to control the walk, he is very responsive to a corrective pull back on the leash and it makes a little metal zip sound when he </li>
                            <li>he likes to chew on his bones and squeak his toys but, can't really play with him that much in our tiny house lol</li>
                            <li>feel free to give him one of the raw bones in the freezer a day, especially in his cage if you have to leave</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>bedtime</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>he's so good! just take him out back for a pee then "Go to your bed!"</li>
                            <li>he'll run into his crate, give him a treat and a "Good boy!" with treats</li>
                            <li>close the fold of the blanket down to help him settle</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>leaving</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>he has seperation anxiety and hates when he's left alone :(</li>
                            <li>if you do have to leave, especially for longer than a couple hours, give him 1 or 1 1/2 of his anti-anxiety meds about 2 hours before hand</li>
                            <li>it takes a while for those meds to kick in and it lasts for about 6 - 8 hours</li>
                            <li>While you're getting ready to leave, distract him by giving him a raw bone from the freezer and/or peanut butter frozen in his kong</li>
                            <li>tell him "Go to your bed" throw in the and close crate with blanket covering front</li>
                            <li>we've been trying to sit on the front porch for 15 - 30 minutes after he thinks we've left</li>
                            <li>if he starts to bark we give a loud "BAHH" and clap from the porch then a "Good boy"</li>
                            <li>again, you don't have to do this training, it may help with his anxiety level while your gone and overall stress level while he's in your care which can make your life easier! :)</li>

                        <p>Max is a 3 year old Belgian Malinois we adopted from APA last year, he's the sweetest, smartest most eager to love you kinda guy. He loves snuggling on the couch with you and following you around the house. He takes direction well
                            and is learning boundries. He absolutely loves Dyna the black cat and is scared of Pina the Tortie, he growls at her sometimes when she gets close and he's sleeping. He will trample poor little Bambino when he's excited and
                            doesn't really seem to have an awareness of where his body is, smacks his head and butt into the walls and tables daily :)

                        <h3>issues</h3>
                        <h4>medical</h4>
                        <p>He was found on the side of the road last Feb 2020 after being hit by a car, he has metal plates fused in his front paws and major hip displasia which is why he's a little wobbily after laying down. He shouldn't be running too
                            much, jumping or anything too rigorous as it might tear his metal plates (already tore his right one a few months ago but doesn't bother him at the moment) or put his hip sockets out of joint.</p>
                        <h4>aggression</h4>
                        <p>
                            He has a tendency to be protective and can be aggressive with people, a couple close calls and one incident where he bit my sister in the middle of the night, I think he was startled but the bite did break skin and shook her up. It's risky to have anyone
                            over and if you have food deliveries make sure he's away from the door, on walks avoid walking too close to people or dogs to be safe.

                            <p>
                                He also has separation anxiety and does not like being left alone, the crate training we've been doing has been helping a bit but, it's gonna take some time. Refer to the sections on training and leaving

                        <p>So we did training with APA which was a helpful start but over the past year he has gotten more protective and aggressive with people. He growls at people waking up to the house, delivery people or mailman, or even people parking
                            close. After the bite incident with my sister which, was right after nipping at a person walking behind him at a coffee shop and a runner going by our house when I foolishly had him out front off leash... we knew we needed
                            professional intervention! She made sure we understood that we need to set boundries, claim stuff like the door and front window, don't let him come up to us for affection or follow us around. We had to be the leaders and initiate
                            affection and invite him into our space. We use the corrective low toned growl sound: "BAHHHH" sometimes with a clap or water squirt if needed, then followed with a higher toned: "good boy!" usually 1 to 2 seconds after if
                            he stops the undesired behavior: growling/barking/coming up for affection/violating the boundry of stay or walking ahead of us on leash. If he ever growls or barks at you - this is the correction we were told would work, also
                            first greeting should be arms and hands up by the chest and no eye contact while he sniffs, when he finally ignores he gets a pet/tread/good boy - I'll leave all the printed materials... we certainly don't expect you to continue
                            the training, you can spoil him and just have fun! But we want you to feel safe, secure and confident with our power breed!</p>
                        <h3>food instructions</h3>
                        <p>Get ready for this proprietary blend! Max gets fed twice a day in the morning and evening (usually around 3 or 4ish depending on when Bambino starts whining lol)
                            <ul>
                                <h4>
                                    Here's the breakdown for each feeding:
                                </h4>
                                <li>
                                    Using the half cup scoop in the dry food bin, give him 2 scoops (1 cup) of dry in the big ceramic bowl.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    in the freezer is frozen rectangle boards that are actually 100% raw food, he gets half of one, thawed, either the day before in the fridge or at room temp for about 20 minutes
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    lastly he gets a food topper, the small blue box in the fridge or new box on top of the dry food bin. About a large spoonful dollop
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    add in some water and mix it all in, if the raw food is too frozen he might throw it up so make sure it's a nice soupy blend!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Make him "Go to bed" in his crate while you're getting it all ready, he lays down and doesn't move. Then put it in front of him, wait a few seconds and say "Okay!" he will eat it laying down in his crate or even put it a few feet
                            in front of the crate so he can stand up and eat it.
                        </p>
                        <p> Fill his water bowl everyday, he drinks about half a gallon a day!

                        <h3>profile</h3>
                        <p>Max is a 3 year old Belgian Malinois we adopted from APA last year, he's the sweetest, smartest most eager to love you kinda guy. He loves snuggling on the couch with you and following you around the house. He takes direction well
                            and is learning boundries. He absolutely loves Dyna the black cat and is scared of Pina the Tortie, he growls at her sometimes when she gets close and he's sleeping. He will trample poor little Bambino when he's excited and
                            doesn't really seem to have an awareness of where his body is, smacks his head and butt into the walls and tables daily :)
                        </p>
                        <h3>issues</h3>
                        <h4>medical</h4>
                        <p>He was found on the side of the road last Feb 2020 after being hit by a car, he has metal plates fused in his front paws and major hip displasia which is why he's a little wobbily after laying down. He shouldn't be running too
                            much, jumping or anything too rigorous as it might tear his metal plates (already tore his right one a few months ago but doesn't bother him at the moment) or put his hip sockets out of joint.</p>
                        <h4>aggression</h4>
                        <p>
                            He has a tendency to be protective and can be aggressive with people, a couple close calls and one incident where he bit my sister in the middle of the night, I think he was startled but the bite did break skin and shook her up. It's risky to have anyone
                            over and if you have food deliveries make sure he's away from the door, on walks avoid walking too close to people or dogs to be safe.
                            <h4>seperation anxiety</h4>
                            <p>
                                He also has separation anxiety and does not like being left alone, the crate training we've been doing has been helping a bit but, it's gonna take some time. Refer to the sections on training and leaving
