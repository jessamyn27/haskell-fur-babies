                        <li>We had to be the leaders and initiate affection and invite him into our space.</li>
                        <li>We use the corrective low toned growl sound: "BAHHHH" sometimes with a clap or water squirt if needed, then followed with a higher toned: "good boy!" and optional treats</li>
                        <li>the undesired behavior: growling/barking/coming up for affection/violating the boundry of stay or walking ahead of us on leash. </li>
                        <li>If he ever growls or barks at you - this "BAHHHH" with optional clap then "Good Boy" with optional treats is the correction we were told would work</li>
                        <li>also first greeting should be arms and hands up by the chest and no eye contact while he sniffs, when he finally ignores he gets a pet/tread/good boy</li>I'll leave all the printed materials... we certainly don't expect you to
                        continue the training, you can spoil him and just have fun! But we want you to feel safe, secure and confident with our power breed!

                    <p>Get ready for this proprietary blend! Max gets fed twice a day in the morning and evening - usually around 3 or 4ish depending on when Bambino starts whining lol
                        <h4>
                            Here's the breakdown for each feeding:
                        </h4>
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                Using the half cup scoop in the dry food bin, give him 2 scoops dry (1 cup) in his big ceramic dog bowl.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                in the fridge all the wet stuff is pre-portioned out for each day so add in half of that in the am / other half in the pm
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                add in some water and mix it all in, if the raw food is too frozen he might throw it up so make sure it's a nice soupy blend!
                            </li>
                            <li>since the shelf life for raw is only 5 days, pull out the pre-portioned from the freezer into the fridge on saturday for sun/mon</li>

                            <li>Make him "Go to bed" in his crate while you're getting it all ready, he lays down and doesn't move. Then put it in front of him, wait a few seconds and say "Okay!" he will eat it laying down in his crate or even put it a few
                                feet in front of the crate so he can stand up and eat it.
                            </li>
                            <li> Fill his water bowl everyday, he drinks about half a gallon a day!

                        <li>if you do have to leave, especially for longer than a couple hours, give him 1 or 1 1/2 of his anti-anxiety meds about 2 hours before hand</li>
                        <li>it takes a while for those meds to kick in and it lasts for about 6 - 8 hours</li>
                        <li>While you're getting ready to leave, distract him by giving him a raw bone from the freezer and/or peanut butter frozen in his kong</li>

                        <li>we've been trying to sit on the front porch for 15 - 30 minutes after he thinks we've left

                        <li>if he starts to bark we give a loud "BAHH" and clap from the porch then a "Good boy"</li>
                        <li>again, you don't have to do this training, it may help with his anxiety level while your gone and overall stress level while he's in your care which can make your life easier! :)

                        <li>Bambino is a little snuggle bug and just curls up on the couch in his little bed and only whines when he needs to go potty, drink water, or it's close to meal time lol.</li>
                        <li>He had to have his eyes emergency removed about a year ago, after going suddenly blind overnight. It's a phenomenon that has stumped all the doctors. He's so happy you wouldn't even know it's an issue</li>
                        <li> he likes walking around the backyard a little and he loves snuggling at night in bed with you too.

                            as an old small blind dog with no teeth... he has some issues lol. luckily, he'll let you know what he needs with escalating sounds from whines to yipes then loud barks! the priority of needs to check on usually goes as so:
                        </li>
                        <li>water, outside to pee, outside to poop (can take a few tries), food, snuggles</li>
                        <li>he does have a little throat thing, constantly needing to clear it, i don't remember what it's called but it helps him to stand up and walk through it if it gets bad, i usually offer water too</li>

                            on the floor, we carry him everywhere he needs to be</li>

                    <p>Same proprietary blend! Max gets fed twice a day in the morning and evening (usually around 3 or 4ish depending on when Bambino starts whining lol)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>
                            Here's the breakdown for each feeding:
                        </h4>
                        <li>
                            Using the half cup scoop in the dry food bin, give him about half a scoop (1/4 cup) of dry in the metal bowl that goes in his pink set up.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            in the fridge all the wet stuff is pre-portioned out for each day so add in half of that in the am / other half in the pm
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            add in some water and mix it all in, if the raw food is too frozen he might throw it up so make sure it's a nice soupy blend!
                        </li>
                        <li>since the shelf life for raw is only 5 days, pull out the pre-portioned from the freezer into the fridge on saturday for sun/mon</li>

                        <li>give it to him on the couch in his pink water/food setup and make him sit and then "Okay!"
                        </li>
                        <li>if you're chillin with him you can leave the water on the coffee table to put in front of him when he whines, sometimes i leave the water in the pink set up on the couch so he can be independent </li>


                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>he needs to go pee first thing in the am, again after breakfast to poop, another pee or two during the day (he'll whine or sit up to let you know), another pee and poop in the evening after his dinner, and another pee for bed</li>
                        <li>always out back not front, too risky, pick him up and plop him in the area to the left - Greg has raked out the poop as much as he can so hopefully he and you don't step in it! I'd place him further towards the fence to be safe</li>
                        <li>say "Go Potty!" and snap fingers, I like to hum or sometimes play news or music on my phone, it relaxes him so he knows your there and he concentrates on peeing and pooping</li>
                        <li>he usually starts the morning off with a long pee - I bring him inside to eat - then outside to poop and he usually pees again too, idk if it's just him getting old but it can take a few minutes for the pooping to happen, about
                            30 circles (yes I count them when I'm bored)</li>
                        <li>note: if there's dog barking in the neightborhood he'll get distracted and start barking himself, I like to keep him focused with a "BAHH" and again "Go potty" with finger snaps</li>
                        <li>when he's outside finding a good spot to releive himself he'll walk in lots of circles, if he's about to run into the metal chairs or something, give a "Bambino careful!, turn around" and he'll slow his roll before he whacks into
                            something which startles him and he can lose his momentum</li>
                        <li>if it's cold or rainy it helps to put his orange onsie on when going outside</li>
                        <li>sometimes he steps in his poop or tinkles on his chest or front feet so, use a kitchen rag or paper towel with warm water from the sink and sometimes soap to get it off, then pat it dry</li>

                            just give him a "No it's too early, just wait a little longer" and get him to go back under the covers :)</li>

                        <li>he has two soft crates you can use, we'll set up the big one when we leave. It's better to use b/c there's less chance that he'll stress pee or poop and walk all in it, also enough room for his grass mat and food/water dish </li>
                        <li>i would try to get him to pee and poop best you can before leaving him and stick him in as the last thing you do</li>
                        <li>i would give him some cat food / treats in his bowl and sprinkled around the floor of the pen</li>
                        <li>he also can have anti-anxiety meds that Max has if you're leaving for more than 2 hours, you can give him 1/6th of a pill about 2 hours before hand, with a little food</li>
                        <li>he starts barking and pacing when he knows Max is anxious so it does help to "leave" and then sit on the front porch and "BAHH" them from the porch until they chill out</li>
                        <li>again the zoom on the mac helps so you can hear if they're freaking out or chillin out so you can have an idea of how long you should leave them and what you're coming back to</li>

                                Pina is the smartest animal by far, about 6? possibly feral, she was found under a dumpster as a kitten and has been our wild child ever since.</li>
                            <li>She spends the days and nights outside mostly but, she has been staying in the house more and more
                                <li>she will "snap" at an insulating door rubber that's come loose to let us know she wants to come in to eat or just say hi.</li>she'll pace and hang at the back door if she wants to go back out</li>
                            <li>with the cold days and nights lately, she's been actually staying in at night, under the tree, on the bed... just kinda wherever</li>
                            <li></li>

                            <li>she pesters Dyna, takes swipes at Max and growls when picked up against her will... she's got a 'tude for sure!
                                <li>She gets actually dangerously triggered when she sees a stray animal or in any way feels unsafe and will straight up attack whoever is in her perimeter so, look for those signs and get her out to the backyard and all animals
                                    and yourself safely inside!</li>
                                <li>it hasn't happened in a long time but, look out for hissing and growling, poofy raised fur and stomping around, get her outside and let her cool down, cuz those claws are vicious</li>
                                <li>we keep her collar on her outside with an apple tracker in case she ever takes off, and bells on it so she scares away birds and squirrels when she hunts them</li>
                                <li>she's actually buddies with a little tailless squireel we named Gus-Gus who you'll undoubtably see in and around the yard, they chase each other and generally hang out in the morning which is adorable if you get to see
                                    it!

                            <li>they might be shy of you at first so make sure they are coming in from outside to eat at least twice a day</li>
