                            The haskell house is small but great! It's 101 years old and about 600 sq ft. Located in
                            east downtown it's a great spot for dog walking, minutes from the trail along the water
                            (fiesta park). We have a big backyard with a stocktank pool in the summer
                            and firepit in the winter. We vibed it out string lights, chimes and bells.
                            <br> I'm Jessamyn, a software engineer and Greg is a music researcher and bass player in a
                            couple touring bands.

                        <h3>profile</h3>
                        <p>Max is a 3 year old Belgian Malinois we adopted from APA last year, he's the sweetest,
                            smartest most eager to love you kinda
                            guy. He loves snuggling on the couch with you and following you around the house. He takes
                            direction well and is learning boundries. He absolutely loves Dyna the black cat and is
                            scared of Pina the Tortie, he growls at her sometimes when she gets close and he's sleeping.
                            He will trample poor little Bambino when he's excited and doesn't really seem to have an
                            awareness of where his body is, smacks his head and butt into the walls and tables daily :)
                        </p>
                        <h3>issues</h3>
                        <h4>medical</h4>
                        <p>He was found on the side of the road last Feb 2020 after being hit by a car, he has metal
                            plates fused in his front paws and major hip displasia which is why he's a little wobbily
                            after laying down. He shouldn't be running too much, jumping or anything too rigorous as it
                            might tear his metal plates (already tore his right one a few months ago but doesn't bother
                            him at the moment) or put his hip sockets out of joint.</p>
                        <h4>aggression</h4>
                        <p>
                            He has a tendency to be protective and can be aggressive with people, a couple close calls
                            and one incident where he bit my sister in the middle of the night, I think he was startled
                            but the bite did break skin and shook her up. It's risky to have anyone over and if you have
                            food deliveries make sure he's away from the door, on walks avoid walking too close to
                            people or dogs to be
                            safe.
                            <h4>seperation anxiety</h4>
                            <p>
                                He also has separation anxiety and does not like being left alone, the crate training
                                we've been doing has been helping a bit but, it's gonna take some time. Refer to the
                                sections on training and leaving
                            </p>
                        </p>
                        <h3>training</h3>
                        <p>So we did training with APA which was a helpful start but over the past year he has gotten
                            more protective and aggressive with people. He growls at people waking up to the house,
                            delivery people or mailman, or even people parking close. After the bite incident with my
                            sister which, was right after nipping at a person walking behind him at a coffee shop and a
                            runner going by our house when I foolishly had him out front off leash... we knew we needed
                            professional intervention! She made sure we understood that we need to set boundries, claim
                            stuff like the door and front window, don't let him come up to us for affection or follow us
                            around. We had to be the leaders and initiate affection and invite him into our space. We
                            use the corrective low toned growl sound: "BAHHHH" sometimes with a clap or water squirt if
                            needed, then followed with a higher toned: "good boy!" usually 1 to 2 seconds after if he
                            stops the undesired behavior: growling/barking/coming up for affection/violating the boundry
                            of stay or walking ahead of us on leash. If he ever growls or barks at you - this is the
                            correction we were told would work, also first greeting should be arms and hands up by the
                            chest and no eye contact while he sniffs, when he finally ignores he gets a pet/tread/good
                            boy - I'll leave all the printed materials... we certainly don't expect you to continue the
                            training, you can spoil him and just have fun! But we want you to feel safe, secure and
                            confident with our power breed!</p>
                        <h3>food instructions</h3>
                        <p>Get ready for this proprietary blend! Max gets fed twice a day in the morning and evening
                            (usually around 3 or 4ish depending on when Bambino starts whining lol) <ul>
                                <h4>
                                    Here's the breakdown for each feeding:
                                </h4>
                                <li>
                                    Using the half cup scoop in the dry food bin, give him 2 scoops (1 cup) of dry in
                                    the big
                                    ceramic bowl.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    in the freezer is frozen rectangle boards that are actually 100% raw food, he gets
                                    half
                                    of
                                    one, thawed, either the day before in the fridge or at room temp for about 20
                                    minutes
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    lastly he gets a food topper, the small blue box in the fridge or new box on top of
                                    the dry
                                    food bin. About a large spoonful dollop
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    add in some water and mix it all in, if the raw food is too frozen he might throw it
                                    up so
                                    make sure it's a nice soupy blend!
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Make him "Go to bed" in his crate while you're getting it all ready, he lays down and doesn't
                            move. Then put it in front of him, wait a few seconds and say "Okay!" he will eat it laying
                            down in his crate or even put it a few feet in front of the crate so he can stand up and eat
                            it.
                        </p>
                        <p> Fill his water bowl everyday, he drinks about half a gallon a day!
